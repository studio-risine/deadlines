## Overview

Implement the Process Detail View UI component according to the PRD specifications. This component will provide a comprehensive interface for viewing complete process information, related entities, and process history with proper navigation and action capabilities.

## Context

Currently, there is a basic `ProcessView` component that is mostly empty. This needs to be implemented to display complete process details, related deadlines and cases, and provide navigation to edit and other related functions as specified in the PRD.

## Requirements

### UI Specification

**Location:** `/dashboard/processes/:id`

**Layout Components:**
- Header with process information summary
- Tab navigation: Overview, Deadlines, Cases, History
- Action buttons: Edit, Delete (admin only), Add Deadline, Add Case
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Loading and error states

**Design Requirements:**
- Use ShadcnUI components (Tabs, Cards, Buttons)
- Follow Slate theme design system
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Proper data visualization and hierarchy
