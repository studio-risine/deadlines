## Overview

Implement comprehensive authorization rules for the Process Module according to the PRD specifications. This includes role-based access control, data security measures, and proper enforcement across all API endpoints and UI components.

## Context

Currently, the application may have basic authentication but lacks comprehensive authorization rules specific to process management. This implementation will establish role-based access control, define user permissions, and ensure secure data access patterns.

## Requirements

### Authorization Specification (from PRD)

**Access Control Rules:**
- **Create:** Authenticated users
- **Read:** Authenticated users (own processes) + Admins (all processes)
- **Update:** Authenticated users (own processes) + Admins (all processes)
- **Delete:** Admins only

**Data Security:**
- Process data visible only to authorized users
- Audit trail for all modifications
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

## User Tasks

### Role Definition
- [ ] Define user roles in the system (Regular User, Admin)
- [ ] Create role constants and enums for consistent usage
- [ ] Implement role assignment and verification logic
- [ ] Add role information to user authentication context

### Convex Authorization Implementation
- [ ] Implement user authentication checks in all Convex functions
- [ ] Add role-based authorization middleware or helpers
- [ ] Create authorization utility functions for common checks
- [ ] Implement process ownership verification logic

### API Endpoint Authorization
- [ ] **Create Process (POST):** Verify user is authenticated
- [ ] **List Processes (GET):** Filter results based on user permissions
- [ ] **Get Process Details (GET):** Verify user can access specific process
- [ ] **Update Process (PUT):** Verify user owns process or is admin
- [ ] **Delete Process (DELETE):** Verify user is admin

### Data Filtering Logic
- [ ] Implement user-based data filtering for regular users
- [ ] Allow admins to see all processes
- [ ] Filter soft-deleted processes based on user permissions
- [ ] Ensure related data (deadlines, cases) follows same authorization rules

### Process Ownership Management
- [ ] Add process ownership tracking (createdBy field)
- [ ] Implement ownership verification functions
- [ ] Handle process ownership transfer if needed
- [ ] Ensure ownership is set correctly during creation

### UI Component Authorization
- [ ] Hide/show action buttons based on user permissions
- [ ] Implement route-level authorization guards
- [ ] Display appropriate error messages for unauthorized access
- [ ] Ensure UI respects backend authorization rules

### Error Handling
- [ ] Return 401 for unauthenticated access attempts
- [ ] Return 403 for insufficient permissions
- [ ] Provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive information
- [ ] Log authorization failures for security monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Authentication Requirements
- [ ] All API endpoints require user authentication
- [ ] Unauthenticated requests receive 401 error
- [ ] Authentication context is available in all functions
- [ ] User identity is properly verified

### Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] Regular users can create new processes
- [ ] Regular users can view and edit only their own processes
- [ ] Admin users can view and edit all processes
- [ ] Only admin users can delete processes
- [ ] Role verification works correctly across all operations

### Data Security
- [ ] Users cannot access other users' processes
- [ ] Process data is filtered based on ownership
- [ ] Related entities follow same authorization rules
- [ ] Sensitive information is properly protected

### API Authorization
- [ ] Create endpoint verifies authentication only
- [ ] List endpoint filters data based on user permissions
- [ ] Get detail endpoint verifies process access
- [ ] Update endpoint verifies ownership or admin role
- [ ] Delete endpoint verifies admin role

### UI Authorization
- [ ] Edit buttons only appear for processes user can edit
- [ ] Delete buttons only appear for admin users
- [ ] Navigation guards prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Error pages handle authorization failures gracefully

### Error Handling
- [ ] 401 errors for authentication failures
- [ ] 403 errors for authorization failures
- [ ] Error messages are informative but secure
- [ ] Authorization failures are logged for security

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test role verification functions
- [ ] Test process ownership checks
- [ ] Test authorization helper functions
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test data filtering logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test end-to-end authorization flows
- [ ] Test API endpoint authorization
- [ ] Test UI component authorization
- [ ] Test cross-user access attempts

### Security Tests
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Test privilege escalation scenarios
- [ ] Test data leakage prevention
- [ ] Test session and token handling

### Role-Based Tests
- [ ] Test regular user permissions
- [ ] Test admin user permissions
- [ ] Test role transitions (if applicable)
- [ ] Test role-based UI behavior

## Implementation Details

### Convex Authorization Patterns
```typescript
// Example authorization helper
export async function verifyProcessAccess(ctx: any, processId: string) {
  const user = await getCurrentUser(ctx);
  if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
  
  const process = await ctx.db.get(processId);
  if (!process) throw new Error("Process not found");
  
  // Allow access if user owns process or is admin
  if (process.createdBy === user._id || user.role === "admin") {
    return process;
  }
  
  throw new Error("Insufficient permissions");
}
```

### UI Authorization Guards
```typescript
// Example route guard
function RequireAuth({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const user = useCurrentUser();
  
  if (!user) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```
